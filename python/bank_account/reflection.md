What I Learned
- How to use classes and objects in Python.  
- The role of the constructor (`__init__`) in setting up data.  
- How to write methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, etc.) that interact with object data.  
- Why validation is important (to prevent negative amounts, overdrafts, or invalid input).  
- The difference between printing values for the user and returning values for further use.  

What I Would Do Better
- Add a transaction history to track deposits and withdrawals.  
- Generate unique account numbers for each account.  
- Store account data in a file or database so it persists after the program ends.  
- Build a simple user interface (command-line or GUI) for easier use.  
- Write unit tests to automatically check that all methods work correctly.
